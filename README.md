Leaf Walk is a fork of Lafstride to... i can't think...

How to Use
----------

Simply download and install Leafstride and it will automatically apply to all of the leaves in your world. Every node in your world that has `group:leaves` will be modified.

The movement resistance caused by leaves can be configured via Settings > All Settings > Content: Mods > Leafstride. The value can range from 0 to 7; a value of 0 will not slow players down at all while a value of 7 will slow players down greatly. The default value of 2 offers a good middle ground.
